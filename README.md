### 작은 일일지라도 끝까지 고민하는 신입 개발자 한지현입니다.
Hi, there👋
I'm Jihyun, and, recently, I have been really deep into IT field.
Before starting to talk about my keen love for this field, let me introduce myself shortly.
I have diverse work experiences in Education, NGO, Finance and etc for approximately 6 years.
Throughout my careers, I, luckily, could have opportunities to communicate with many people who are involved in diverse fields, especially, I was able to have many experiences to co-work with ICT division such as managing e-learning system on LMS, website renewal(for the first time in ten years!).
Thanks for these chances, I could have experiences how IT skills can meet people's needs wonderfully and even change life qualities directly and indirectly, and that finally leads me career changes. I'm really excited to dive this fields!
