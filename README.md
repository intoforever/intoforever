- 작은 일일지라도 끝까지 고민하는 신입 개발자입니다.
- 교육, NGO, 금융 등 다양한 분야에서 일하면서 ICT팀과 협업할 기회를 많이 접하게 되었고<br>
기술이 삶을 바꾸는 크고 작은 기회를 경험하면서 개발에 대한 꿈을 갖게 되었습니다.

Hi, there👋 I'm Jihyun. Recently, I have been really deep into IT field.<br>
Before starting to talk about my keen love for this field, let me introduce myself shortly.<br>
I have diverse work experiences in Education, NGO, Finance and etc, for approximately 6 years.
Throughout my careers, I luckily could communicate with many people involved in diverse fields. Especially, among them, I was able to have many opportunities to co-work with ICT division through e-learning systems and website renewal project(for the first time in ten years!).<br>
Thanks for these chances, I could have been watching how IT skills can meet people's needs wonderfully and even change their life qualities directly and indirectly by side. (and yes! these points finally lead me make my career changes.) I'm really excited to dive this fields.
